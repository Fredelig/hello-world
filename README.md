# hello-world
My quest to conquer the universe begins here ;-)

I'm a laidback geek, 40 years of age, from Trondheim, Norway. I'll give it my best to become a senior programmer. I feel that programming is something for me, why I haven't done more of it, well, life has thrown me a few screwballs. My interests include English humour, Monty Python, Young Ones, Rowan Atkinson to name a few. Prog rock, old classical music, Bach, Pink Floyd, Mike Oldfield, Jean-Michel Jarre, Enya among other things. Craft beer, computers, figurative art, video games, mother nature, being outdoors, trekking in the woods.
